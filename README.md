# A5 C++ Library

The A5 library is a collection of 5 custom memory allocators that can be used instead of the default malloc/new functions
inorder to manage a large heap of memory ourselves and save the memory request from the OS while also keeping fragmentation to minmimum
and data locality to maximum.
